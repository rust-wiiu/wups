# Wii U Plugin System

The [Wii U Plugin System](https://github.com/wiiu-env/WiiUPluginSystem) is a plugin system for the [Aroma Homebrew environment](https://github.com/wiiu-env/Aroma). Plugins can be hooked into different parts of the main application (e.g. when application starts, function is called, etc) and are able to run in the background.

For information regarding installation, usage, etc take a look at [Book for U](https://rust-wiiu.github.io/book-for-u/). General information can be found found at [rust-wiiu README](https://github.com/rust-wiiu/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md).
